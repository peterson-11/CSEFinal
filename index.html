<h7>User Prompted Depression/Anxiety Case Comparison<h7/>
<p7>Here, we prompt the user to choose an indicator disorder in particular that they want to analyze since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our prompts include specifying the indicator, primary comparison group, secondary segmentation, and location scope. We then provide a usual visual comparing the two primary groups that include min, max, mean, lower and upper quartile. We also provide a secondary graph consisting of the specified sub group and their values depending on the specified indicator.<p7/>
